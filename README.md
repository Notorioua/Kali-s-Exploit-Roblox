# Kali-s-Exploit-Roblox
Kali's Exploit, More Known as KaliXploit Or Kali Exploit Is A Newly Developed Roblox Microsoft Store Version Exploit, containing many APIS even Our Own, KaliAPI. Kali's Exploit Was Made By Notorioua. I Am the Owner Of Notorioua AND WE AREN'T GONNA REVEAL OURSELVES (For now.) Call Me And My Assistant(s) Anonymus Kali Dev. Nora Is One Of Our TradeMarks To Let You Know. Cheers, Nora :)
Notorioua Is Also A Cheat Engine Fan, We Love And Enjoy Making Our Product(s).  Love To Cheat Engine (CE). 
Huge Credit(S) To Other(s) API(s) Used In Kali's Exploit.
One Of Them Being "WeAreDevs.Net" With Their WeAreDevs_API.dll. 
ALONGSIDE, Our Own Kali API. (API is Based Off A Secret Exploit Later Revealed In This Readme.md ðŸ¤«) 
Go With Whichever You want, It's Up To you!
Kali API Is Completely Safe, Checkabale in Virustotal.com.
Wearedevs Is Also Safe, Well In Notorioua's Opinion. Alot Of People Say It's Not Trustable Or It Has A Cryptominer. But That Isn't true, you see
If you use JJsploit Then yeah I Don't Know About JJSploit (79% Of The Time People Find It Untrustable, As a Detected Silent Crypto Miner).
Notorioua Is Also The Developer Of CarSploit. (Secret Exploit ðŸ¤«). (CarS_API=<Kali_API Because Of Kali being newer and not a secret.)
In The File, Nexploit Is A Alternative Exe Launch If The Notorious Kali's Exploit By Notorioua Doesn't Launch/Crashes. If This Happens Launch Nexploit. If Both Of Them Won't Work, Report Bugs In Notoriouas Discord server (Not Yet Released) 
It Can Also Go In The Other Way, Which make's Nexploit And Kali's Exploit Both Usable and Both Developed By Notorioua.
Cheers, Best Regards,
Notorioua's Owner, AnonymusKaliDev. :)
